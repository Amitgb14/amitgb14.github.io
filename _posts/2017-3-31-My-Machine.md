I'm using Dell Inspiron 15 laptop running on Fedora 23 Linux OS.

Fedora is based on RPM and developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat.


Hardware details,

	*) Memory : 3.7 GiB
	*) Processor : Intel® Core™ i3-3217U CPU @ 1.80GHz × 4 
	*) OS Type : 64-bit
	*) Graphics : Intel® Ivybridge Mobile
	*) GNOME : Version 3.18.2
	*) Disk : 500 GB

That's enough requirement for my programming. Mostly I work on Python, C++ software development.
Have task like Linux compilation and build is possible but it consume more resource, So I little bit try on my laptop.
